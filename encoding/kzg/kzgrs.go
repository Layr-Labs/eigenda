	// G2Path and G2TrailingPath are only needed if LoadG2Points is true.
	// G2 points are used to generate the blob length proof.
	//
	// There are 2 ways to configure G2 points:
	// 1. Entire G2 SRS file (16GiB) is provided via G2Path
	// 2. G2Path and G2TrailingPath both contain at least SRSNumberToLoad points,
	//    where G2Path contains the first part of the G2 SRS file, and G2TrailingPath
	//    contains the trailing end of the G2 SRS file.
	// TODO(samlaf): to prevent misconfigurations and simplify the code, we should probably not multiplex G2Path like this,
	// and instead use a G2PrefixPath config. Then EITHER G2Path is used, OR both G2PrefixPath and G2TrailingPath are used.

	// Generating these on startup would take hours otherwise.
	PreloadEncoder bool
	// Path to SRS Table directory. Always required even if PreloadEncoder is false,
	// because the prover will write the SRS tables to this directory if they are not already present.
