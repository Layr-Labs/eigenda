  # Allow certain patterns to be ignored by lll (long lines)
  # This should probably be 120 to match our lll rule, but there is a weird interaction which an external contributor
  # hit. The bug was a string smaller than 120, but with key + string made the line bigger than 120, which invalidated
  # the exclusion rule.

  # Diff compared to master will be linted by default, but the --new-from-rev= flag can be used when running the linter
  # to lint the diff between the feature and a different target. This is how CI handles the linting: it lints the diff
  # between the feature branch, and the branch being merged into.
