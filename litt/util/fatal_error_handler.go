// ErrorMonitor is a struct that permits the process to "panic" without using the golang panic keyword.
// When there are goroutines that function under the hood that are unable to return errors using the standard pattern,
// this utility provides an elegant way to handle those errors. In such situations, the desirable outcome is for the
// process to report the error and to elegantly spin itself down.
//
// Even though this utility can "panic", it is not the same as the panic that is built into Go. The Panic() method
// should be called in situations where recovery is not possible, i.e. the same situations where one would otherwise use
// as a golang panic. The big difference is that calling Panic() will not result in the process immediately being torn
// down.
