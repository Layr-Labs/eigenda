Implements the necessary [EigenDA](https://docs.eigencloud.xyz/products/eigenda/core-concepts/overview) proving and verifying infrastructure to facilitate rollups creating trustless integrations with EigenDA.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built using a modular architecture with specialized crates:

### Core Crates

| Crate | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **`eigenda-ethereum`** | Ethereum contract interaction | Provider utilities, contract bindings |
| **`eigenda-proxy`** | EigenDA proxy service communication | Blob retrieval, certificate generation, retry logic |
| **`eigenda-verification`** | Cryptographic verification, validation, and state extraction | Certificate parsing, storage proofs, operator stake extraction, BLS signatures, commitment proofs |
| **`eigenda-srs-data`** | Structured reference string data | BN254 curve parameters for KZG commitments |

## 🎯 Usage

This SDK provides framework-agnostic components for integrating EigenDA with any rollup infrastructure. The first production deployment is the [Sovereign SDK](https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk) data availability adapter, which leverages these crates to enable trustless EigenDA integration for Sovereign rollups.

While initially developed to support Sovereign SDK, these crates are designed as general-purpose building blocks that can be adopted by other rollup frameworks seeking to integrate with EigenDA.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- ✅ **Ethereum Node**: Access to Ethereum mainnet RPC
- ✅ **EigenDA Proxy**: Connection to EigenDA proxy service

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda.git
cd eigenda/rust

# Build all crates
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The crates provide modular components for EigenDA integration that can be composed based on your rollup's needs. Key configuration points include:

- **Ethereum RPC endpoint** for contract interaction
- **EigenDA Proxy URL** for blob operations
- **Rollup namespace** for transaction filtering

## 🔧 How It Works

These crates provide the foundational components needed to trustless EigenDA integrations with various rollup frameworks:

### Core Capabilities

**Ethereum Integration** (`eigenda-ethereum`)
- Contract interaction and state queries
- Ethereum block monitoring
- State proof generation

**Proxy Communication** (`eigenda-proxy`)
- Blob submission and retrieval
- Certificate management
- Retry logic and error handling

**Cryptographic Verification** (`eigenda-verification`)
- ✅ EigenDA certificate validation
- ✅ BLS aggregate signature verification
- ✅ KZG commitment proof validation
- ✅ Ethereum state proof verification
- ✅ Operator stake extraction and validation

**SRS Data** (`eigenda-srs-data`)
- BN254 curve parameters for KZG operations
- Structured reference string management

## 🧪 Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
