// Keeps track of the cumulative payment state for on-demand dispersals for a single account.
//
// On-demand payments use a cumulative payment system where, each time a dispersal is made, we keep track of the total
// amount paid by the account for that and all previous dispersals. The cumulative payment is chosen by the client
// based on the state of its local accounting, and the chosen value can be verified by checking:
// 1. that the claimed value is <= the total deposits belonging to the account in the PaymentVault contract
// 2. that the value has increased by at least the cost of the dispersal from the previously observed value
//
// The cost of each dispersal is calculated by multiplying the number of symbols (with a minimum of minNumSymbols) by
// the pricePerSymbol.
//
// On-demand payments are currently limited to quorums 0 (ETH) and 1 (EIGEN) and can only be used when dispersing
// through the EigenDA disperser.
//
// This is a goroutine safe struct, with some caveats. While the methods themselves can be called concurrently, there
// are some practical concurrency limits based on the logic behind on-demand payments:
// 1. Dispersals must be accounted for *in order*, since cumulative payment may only increase. Example:
// - Assume a user creates two on-demand dispersals, `A` and `B`
// - `B` will have a higher cumulative payment, since it was created second
// - If the dispersals are accounted for out of order (`B` then `A`), then the accounting for `A` will fail,
// since cumulative payment from `B`->`A` would decrease
// 2. Debit reversion is only possible for a dispersal if no subsequent dispersals have been accounted for. Example:
// - Assume a user creates two on-demand dispersals, `A` and `B`
// - If `A` is accounted for, the debit for `A` can be reverted *only if* `B` has not yet been accounted for
// - If this is not respected, the entity doing the accounting will diverge from the correct ledger state
//
// TODO(litt3): There are some improvements that may be made to the on-demand logic in the future, to permit a larger
// number of concurrent on-demand dispersals.
