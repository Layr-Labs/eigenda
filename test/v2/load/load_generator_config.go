	// By default, this utility reads each blob back from each relay once. The number of
	// reads per relay is multiplied by this factor. For example, If this is set to 3,
	// then each blob is read back from each relay 3 times. If less than 1, then this value
	// is treated as a probability. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then each blob is read back
	// from each relay with a 50% chance.
	RelayReadAmplification float64
	// By default, this utility reads chunks once. The number of chunk reads is multiplied
	// by this factor. If this is set to 3, then chunks are read back 3 times. If less than 1,
	// then this value is treated as a probability. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then
	// each chunk is read back from validators with a 50% chance.
	ValidatorReadAmplification float64
	// A number between 0 and 1.0 that specifies the fraction of blobs that are verified by the validator.
	// If 1.0, all blobs are verified. If 0.0, no blobs are verified. If 0.5, half of the blobs are verified.
	ValidatorVerificationFraction float64
	// The maximum number of parallel blobs submissions in flight.
	SubmissionParallelism uint64
	// The maximum number of parallel blob relay read operations in flight.
	RelayReadParallelism uint64

	ValidatorReadParallelism uint64
	// The timeout for each blob dispersal, in seconds.
	DispersalTimeout uint32
	// The timeout for reading a blob from a relay, in seconds. This is the timeout per individual read.
	RelayReadTimeout uint32
