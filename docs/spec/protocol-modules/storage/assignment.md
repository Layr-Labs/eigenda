# Assignment

The assignment functionality within EigenDA is carried out by the `AssignmentCoordinator`, which is responsible for taking the current OperatorState and the security requirements represented by a given QuorumParam and determining or validating system parameters that will satisfy these security requirements given the OperatorStates. There are two classes of parameters that must be determined or validated:

1) the chunk indices that will be assigned to each DA node.
2) the length of each chunk (measured in number of symbols). In keeping with the constraint imposed by the Encoding module, all chunks must have the same length, so this parameter is a scalar.


## Interface

The AssignmentCoordinator must implement the following interface, which facilitates with the above tasks:

```go
type AssignmentCoordinator interface {

	// GetAssignments calculates the full set of node assignments.
	GetAssignments(state *OperatorState, blobLength uint, info *BlobQuorumInfo) (map[OperatorID]Assignment, AssignmentInfo, error)

	// GetOperatorAssignment calculates the assignment for a specific DA node
	GetOperatorAssignment(state *OperatorState, header *BlobHeader, quorum QuorumID, id OperatorID) (Assignment, AssignmentInfo, error)

	// ValidateChunkLength validates that the chunk length for the given quorum satisfies all protocol requirements
	ValidateChunkLength(state *OperatorState, header *BlobHeader, quorum QuorumID) (bool, error)

	// CalculateChunkLength calculates the chunk length for the given quorum that satisfies all protocol requirements
	CalculateChunkLength(state *OperatorState, blobLength uint, param *SecurityParam) (uint, error)
}
```

## Standard Assignment Security Logic

The standard assignment coordinator implements a very simple logic for determining the number of chunks per node and the chunk length, which we describe here. More background concerning this design can be found in the [Design Document](../../../design/assignment.md)


**Chunk Length**.

The protocol requires that chunk lengths are sufficiently small that operators with a small proportion of stake are able to receive a quantity of data commensurate with their stake share. For each operator $i$, let $S_i$ signify the amount of stake held by that operator. 

We require that the chunk size $C$ satisfy

$$
C \le \text{NextPowerOf2}\left(\frac{B}{\gamma}\max\left(\frac{\min_jS_j}{\sum_jS_j}, \frac{1}{M_\text{max}} \right) \right)
$$


where $\gamma = \beta-\alpha$, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as defined in the [Storage Overview](./overview.md).

This means that as long as an operator has a stake share of at least $1/M_\text{max}$, then the encoded data that they will receive will be within a factor of 2 of their share of stake. Operators with less than $1/M_\text{max}$ of stake will receive no more than a $1/M_\text{max}$ of the encoded data. $M_\text{max}$ represents the maximum number of chunks that the disperser can be required to encode per blob. This limit is included because proving costs scale somewhat super-linearly with the number of chunks. 

In the future, additional constraints on chunk length may be added; for instance, the chunk length may be set in order to maintain a fixed number of chunks per blob across all system states. Currently, the protocol does not mandate a specific value for the chunk length, but will accept the range satisfying the above constraint. The `CalculateChunkLength` function is provided as a convenience function that can be used to find a chunk length satisfying the protocol requirements. 



**Index Assignment**.

For each operator $i$, let $S_i$ signify the amount of stake held by that operator. We want for the number of chunks assigned to operator $i$ to satisfy

$$
\frac{\gamma m_i C}{B} \ge \frac{S_i}{\sum_j S_j}
$$

Let

$$
m_i = \text{ceil}\left(\frac{B S_i}{C\gamma \sum_j S_j}\right)\tag{1}
$$

**Correctness**.
Let's show that any sets $U_q$ and $U_a$ satisfying the constraints in the [Acceptance Guarantee](./overview.md#acceptance-guarantee), the data held by the operators $U_q \setminus U_a$ will constitute an entire blob. The amount of data held by these operators is given by

$$
\sum_{i \in U_q \setminus U_a} m_i C
$$

We have from (1) and from the definitions of $U_q$ and $U_a$ that

$$
\sum_{i \in U_q \setminus U_a} m_i C \ge  =\frac{B}{\gamma}\sum_{i \in U_q \setminus U_a}\frac{S_i}{\sum_j S_j} = \frac{B}{\gamma}\frac{\sum_{i \in U_q} S_i - \sum_{i \in U_a} S_i}{\sum_jS_j} \ge B \frac{\beta-\alpha}{\gamma} = B  \tag{2}
$$

Thus, the reconstruction requirement from the [Encoding](./encoding.md) module is satisfied. 

## Validation Actions

Validation with respect to assignments is performed at different layers of the protocol:

### DA Nodes

When the DA node receives a `StoreChunks` request, it performs the following validation actions relative to each blob header:
- It uses the `ValidateChunkLength` to validate that the `ChunkLength` for the blob satisfies the above constraints. 
- It uses `GetOperatorAssignment` to calculate the chunk indices for which it is responsible, and verifies that each of the chunks that it has received lies on the polynomial at these indices (see [Encoding validation actions](./encoding.md#validation-actions))

This step ensures that each honest node has received the blobs for which it is accountable under the [Standard Assignment Coordinator](#standard-assignment-security-logic).

Since the DA nodes will allow a range of `ChunkLength` values, as long as they satisfy the constraints of the protocol, it is necessary for there to be consensus on the `ChunkLength` that is in use for a particular blob and quorum. For this reason, the `ChunkLength` is included in the `BlobQuorumParam` which is hashed to create the merkle root contained in the `BatchHeaderHash` signed by the DA nodes. 

### Rollup Smart Contract

When the rollup confirms its blob against the EigenDA batch, it checks that the `QuorumThreshold` for the blob is greater than the `AdversaryThreshold`. This means that if the `ChunkLength` determined by the disperser is invalid, the batch cannot be confirmed as a sufficient number of nodes will not sign.
