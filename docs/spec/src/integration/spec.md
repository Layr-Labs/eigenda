# EigenDA V2 Integration Spec

# Overview

The [EigenDA V2](https://docs.eigenda.xyz/releases/v2) release documentation describes the architectural changes that allow for important network performance increases. From the point of view of rollup integrations, there are three important new features:

1. Blob batches are no longer bridged to Ethereum with dispersals now being confirmed once a batch has been `CERTIFIED`  (i.e, signed over by operator set). This operation takes 10-20 seconds - providing lower confirmation latency and higher throughput for the rollup. Verification of the blobs now needs to be done by the rollup stack.
2. Centralized (accounting done by disperser) payments model
3. A new relay API from which to retrieve blobs (distinct from the disperser API which is now only used to disperse blobs)

# Diagrams

We will refer to the below diagrams throughout the spec.

  VP-->>V: Return validated blob
