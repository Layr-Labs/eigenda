# ZKsync

ZKSync-era currently supports and maintains a [validium mode](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/running/validium), which means we don't need to fork ZKSync, unlike the other stacks.

The zksync eigenda client is implemented [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/8ce774d20865a2b5223d26e10e227f0ea7cb3693/core/node/da_clients/src/eigen). It makes use of our [eigenda-client-rs](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-client-rs) repo.
