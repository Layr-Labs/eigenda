<a name="churner-ChurnReply"></a>

### ChurnReply



| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| signature_with_salt_and_expiry | [SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry](#churner-SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry) |  | The signature signed by the Churner. |
| operators_to_churn | [OperatorToChurn](#churner-OperatorToChurn) | repeated | A list of existing operators that get churned out. This list will contain all quorums specified in the ChurnRequest even if some quorums may not have any churned out operators. If a quorum has available space, OperatorToChurn object will contain the quorum ID and empty operator and pubkey. The smart contract should only churn out the operators for quorums that are full.

For example, if the ChurnRequest specifies quorums 0 and 1 where quorum 0 is full and quorum 1 has available space, the ChurnReply will contain two OperatorToChurn objects with the respective quorums. OperatorToChurn for quorum 0 will contain the operator to churn out and OperatorToChurn for quorum 1 will contain empty operator (zero address) and pubkey. The smart contract should only churn out the operators for quorum 0 because quorum 1 has available space without having any operators churned. Note: it&#39;s possible an operator gets churned out just for one or more quorums (rather than entirely churned out for all quorums). |

Note: - If any of the quorum here has already been registered, this entire request will fail to proceed. - If any of the quorum fails to register, this entire request will fail. - Regardless of whether the specified quorums are full or not, the Churner will return parameters for all quorums specified here. The smart contract will determine whether it needs to churn out existing operators based on whether the quorums have available space. The IDs must be in range [0, 254]. |

<a name="churner-Churner"></a>

### Churner
The Churner is a service that handles churn requests from new operators trying to
join the EigenDA network.
When the EigenDA network reaches the maximum number of operators, any new operator
trying to join will have to make a churn request to this Churner, which acts as the
sole decision maker to decide whether this new operator could join, and if so, which
existing operator will be churned out (so the max number of operators won&#39;t be
exceeded).
The max number of operators, as well as the rules to make churn decisions, are
defined onchain, see details in OperatorSetParam at:
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/blob/master/src/interfaces/IBLSRegistryCoordinatorWithIndices.sol#L24.

<a name="common-BlobCommitment"></a>

### BlobCommitment
BlobCommitment represents commitment of a specific blob, containing its
KZG commitment, degree proof, the actual degree, and data length in number of symbols (field elements).
It deserializes into https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/ce89dab18d2f8f55004002e17dd3a18529277845/encoding/data.go#L27

See https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/e86fb8515eb606d0eebb92097dc60d7238363e77/docs/spec/src/protocol/architecture/encoding.md#validation-via-kzg
to understand how this commitment is used to validate the blob.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| commitment | [bytes](#bytes) |  | Concatenation of the x and y coordinates of `common.G1Commitment`. |
| length_commitment | [bytes](#bytes) |  | A commitment to the blob data with G2 SRS, used to work with length_proof such that the claimed length below is verifiable. |
| length_proof | [bytes](#bytes) |  | A proof that the degree of the polynomial used to generate the blob commitment is valid. It consists of the KZG commitment of x^(SRSOrder-n) * P(x), where P(x) is polynomial of degree n representing the blob. |
| length | [uint32](#uint32) |  | The length of the blob in symbols (field elements), which must be a power of 2. This also specifies the degree of the polynomial used to generate the blob commitment, since length = degree &#43; 1. |






<a name="common-G1Commitment"></a>

### G1Commitment
G1Commitment represents the serialized coordinates of a G1 KZG commitment.
We use gnark-crypto so adopt its serialization, which is big-endian. See:
https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/blob/779e884dabb38b92e677f4891286637a3d2e5734/ecc/bn254/fp/element.go#L862


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| x | [bytes](#bytes) |  | The X coordinate of the KZG commitment. This is the raw byte representation of the field element. x should contain 32 bytes. |
| y | [bytes](#bytes) |  | The Y coordinate of the KZG commitment. This is the raw byte representation of the field element. y should contain 32 bytes. |

<a name="common-v2-Batch"></a>

### Batch
Batch is a batch of blob certificates


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| header | [BatchHeader](#common-v2-BatchHeader) |  | header contains metadata about the batch |
| blob_certificates | [BlobCertificate](#common-v2-BlobCertificate) | repeated | blob_certificates is the list of blob certificates in the batch |






<a name="common-v2-BatchHeader"></a>

### BatchHeader
BatchHeader is the header of a batch of blobs


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| batch_root | [bytes](#bytes) |  | batch_root is the root of the merkle tree of the hashes of blob certificates in the batch |
| reference_block_number | [uint64](#uint64) |  | reference_block_number is the block number that the state of the batch is based on for attestation |






<a name="common-v2-BlobCertificate"></a>

### BlobCertificate
BlobCertificate contains a full description of a blob and how it is dispersed. Part of the certificate
is provided by the blob submitter (i.e. the blob header), and part is provided by the disperser (i.e. the relays).
Validator nodes eventually sign the blob certificate once they are in custody of the required chunks
(note that the signature is indirect; validators sign the hash of a Batch, which contains the blob certificate).


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| blob_header | [BlobHeader](#common-v2-BlobHeader) |  | blob_header contains data about the blob. |
| signature | [bytes](#bytes) |  | signature is an ECDSA signature signed by the blob request signer&#39;s account ID over the BlobHeader&#39;s blobKey, which is a keccak hash of the serialized BlobHeader, and used to verify against blob dispersal request&#39;s account ID |
| relay_keys | [uint32](#uint32) | repeated | relay_keys is the list of relay keys that are in custody of the blob. The relays custodying the data are chosen by the Disperser to which the DisperseBlob request was submitted. It needs to contain at least 1 relay number. To retrieve a blob from the relay, one can find that relay&#39;s URL in the EigenDARelayRegistry contract: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/master/contracts/src/core/EigenDARelayRegistry.sol |






<a name="common-v2-BlobHeader"></a>

### BlobHeader
BlobHeader contains the information describing a blob and the way it is to be dispersed.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| version | [uint32](#uint32) |  | The blob version. Blob versions are pushed onchain by EigenDA governance in an append only fashion and store the maximum number of operators, number of chunks, and coding rate for a blob. On blob verification, these values are checked against supplied or default security thresholds to validate the security assumptions of the blob&#39;s availability. |
| quorum_numbers | [uint32](#uint32) | repeated | quorum_numbers is the list of quorum numbers that the blob is part of. Each quorum will store the data, hence adding quorum numbers adds redundancy, making the blob more likely to be retrievable. Each quorum requires separate payment.

On-demand dispersal is currently limited to using a subset of the following quorums: - 0: ETH - 1: EIGEN

Reserved-bandwidth dispersal is free to use multiple quorums, however those must be reserved ahead of time. The quorum_numbers specified here must be a subset of the ones allowed by the on-chain reservation. Check the allowed quorum numbers by looking up reservation struct: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/1430d56258b4e814b388e497320fd76354bfb478/contracts/src/interfaces/IPaymentVault.sol#L10 |
| commitment | [common.BlobCommitment](#common-BlobCommitment) |  | commitment is the KZG commitment to the blob |
| payment_header | [PaymentHeader](#common-v2-PaymentHeader) |  | payment_header contains payment information for the blob |






<a name="common-v2-PaymentHeader"></a>

### PaymentHeader
PaymentHeader contains payment information for a blob, which is crucial for validating and processing dispersal requests.
The PaymentHeader is designed to support two distinct payment methods within the EigenDA protocol:

1. Reservation-based payment system:
   This system allows users to reserve bandwidth in advance for a specified time period. It&#39;s designed for
   users who need predictable throughput with a fixed ratelimit bin in required or custom quorums.
   Under this method, the user pre-arranges a reservation with specific parameters on the desired quorums:
   - symbolsPerSecond: The rate at which they can disperse data
   - startTimestamp and endTimestamp: The timeframe during which the reservation is active

2. On-demand payment system:
   This is a pay-as-you-go model where users deposit funds into the PaymentVault contract and
   payments are deducted as they make dispersal requests. This system is more flexible but has
   more restrictions on which quorums can be used (currently limited to quorums 0 and 1).

The disperser client always attempts to use a reservation-based payment first if one exists for the account.
If no valid reservation exists or if the reservation doesn&#39;t have enough remaining bandwidth,
the client will fall back to on-demand payment, provided the user has deposited sufficient funds
in the PaymentVault contract.

The distinction between these two payment methods is made by examining:
- For reservation-based: The timestamp must be within an active reservation period, and cumulative_payment is zero or empty
- For on-demand: The cumulative_payment field contains a non-zero value representing the total payment for all dispersals

Every dispersal request is metered based on the size of the data being dispersed, rounded up to the
nearest multiple of the minNumSymbols parameter defined in the PaymentVault contract. The size is calculated as:
symbols_charged = ceiling(blob_size / minNumSymbols) * minNumSymbols
On-demand payments take a step further by calculating the specific cost
cost = symbols_charged * price_per_symbol

Security and Authentication:
The payment header is protected by a cryptographic signature that covers the entire BlobHeader.
This signature is verified during request processing to ensure that:
1. The request is genuinely from the holder of the private key corresponding to account_id
2. The payment information hasn&#39;t been tampered with
3. The same request isn&#39;t being resubmitted (replay protection)

This signature verification happens in core/auth/v2/authenticator.go where:
- The BlobKey (a hash of the serialized BlobHeader) is computed
- The signature is verified against this key
- The recovered public key is checked against the account_id in the payment header

Once a payment has been processed and the signature verified, the disperser server will not
roll back the payment or usage records, even if subsequent processing fails. This design choice
prevents double-spending and ensures payment integrity.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| account_id | [string](#string) |  | The account ID of the disperser client, represented as an Ethereum wallet address in hex format (e.g., &#34;0x1234...abcd&#34;). This field is critical for both payment methods as it:

1. Identifies whose reservation to check for reservation-based payments 2. Identifies whose on-chain deposit balance to check for on-demand payments 3. Provides the address against which the BlobHeader signature is verified

The account_id has special significance in the authentication flow: - When a client signs a BlobHeader, they use their private key - The disperser server recovers the public key from this signature - The recovered public key is converted to an Ethereum address - This derived address must exactly match the account_id in this field

This verification process (implemented in core/auth/v2/authenticator.go&#39;s AuthenticateBlobRequest method) ensures that only the legitimate owner of the account can submit dispersal requests charged to that account. It prevents unauthorized payments or impersonation attacks where someone might try to use another user&#39;s reservation or on-chain balance.

The account_id is typically set by the client&#39;s Accountant when constructing the PaymentMetadata (see api/clients/v2/accountant.go - AccountBlob method). |
| timestamp | [int64](#int64) |  | The timestamp represents the UNIX timestamp in nanoseconds at the time the dispersal request is created. This high-precision timestamp serves multiple critical functions in the protocol:

For reservation-based payments: 1. Reservation Period Determination: The timestamp is used to calculate which reservation period the request belongs to using the formula: reservation_period = floor(timestamp_ns / (reservationPeriodInterval_s * 1e9)) * reservationPeriodInterval_s where reservationPeriodInterval_s is in seconds, and the result is in seconds.

2. Reservation Validity Check: The timestamp must fall within an active reservation window: - It must be &gt;= the reservation&#39;s startTimestamp (in seconds) - It must be &lt; the reservation&#39;s endTimestamp (in seconds)

3. Period Window Check: The server validates that the request&#39;s reservation period is either: - The current period (based on server time) - The immediately previous period This prevents requests with future timestamps or very old timestamps.

4. Rate Limiting: The server uses the timestamp to allocate the request to the appropriate rate-limiting bucket. Each reservation period has a fixed bandwidth limit (symbolsPerSecond * reservationPeriodInterval).

For on-demand payments: 1. Replay Protection: The timestamp helps ensure each request is unique and prevent replay attacks.

2. Global Ratelimiting (TO BE IMPLEMENTED): Treating all on-demand requests as an user-agnostic more frequent reservation, timestamp is checked against the OnDemandSymbolsPerSecond and OnDemandPeriodInterval.

The timestamp is typically acquired by calling time.Now().UnixNano() in Go and accounted for NTP offsets by periodically syncing with a configuratble NTP server endpoint. The client&#39;s Accountant component (api/clients/v2/accountant.go) expects the caller to provide this timestamp, which it then uses to determine the correct reservation period and check bandwidth availability. |
| cumulative_payment | [bytes](#bytes) |  | The cumulative_payment field is a serialized uint256 big integer representing the total amount of tokens paid by the requesting account across all their dispersal requests, including the current one. The unit is in wei. This field is exclusively used for on-demand payments and should be zero or empty for reservation-based payments. If this field is zero or empty, disperser server&#39;s meterer will treat this request as reservation-based. For the current implementation, the choice of quorum doesn&#39;t affect the payment calculations. A client may choose to use any or all of the required quorums.

Detailed Payment Mechanics: 1. Cumulative Design: Rather than sending incremental payment amounts, the protocol uses a cumulative approach where each request states the total amount paid by the account so far. This design: - Prevents double-spending even with concurrent requests - Simplifies verification logic - Requests are enforced by a strictly increasing order

2. Calculation Formula: For a new dispersal request, the cumulative_payment is calculated as: new_cumulative = previous_cumulative &#43; (symbols_charged * price_per_symbol)

 Where: - previous_cumulative: The highest cumulative payment value from previous dispersals - symbols_charged: The blob size rounded up to the nearest multiple of minNumSymbols - price_per_symbol: The cost per symbol set in the PaymentVault contract

3. Validation Process: When the disperser receives a request with a cumulative_payment, it performs multiple validations: - Checks that the on-chain deposit balance in the PaymentVault is sufficient to cover this payment - Verifies the cumulative_payment is greater than the highest previous payment from this account - Verifies the increase from the previous cumulative payment is appropriate for the blob size - If other requests from the same account are currently processing, ensures this new cumulative value is consistent with those (preventing double-spending)

4. On-chain Implementation: The PaymentVault contract maintains: - A deposit balance for each account - Global parameters including minNumSymbols, GlobalSymbolsPerSecond and pricePerSymbol Due to the use of cumulative payments, if a client loses track of their current cumulative payment value, they can query the disperser server for their current payment state using the GetPaymentState RPC. |

<a name="disperser-BlobAuthHeader"></a>

### BlobAuthHeader
BlobAuthHeader contains information about the blob for the client to verify and sign.
- Once payments are enabled, the BlobAuthHeader will contain the KZG commitment to the blob, which the client
will verify and sign. Having the client verify the KZG commitment instead of calculating it avoids
the need for the client to have the KZG structured reference string (SRS), which can be large.
The signed KZG commitment prevents the disperser from sending a different blob to the DA Nodes
than the one the client sent.
- In the meantime, the BlobAuthHeader contains a simple challenge parameter is used to prevent
replay attacks in the event that a signature is leaked.

### BlobStatus
BlobStatus represents the status of a blob.
The status of a blob is updated as the blob is processed by the disperser.
The status of a blob can be queried by the client using the GetBlobStatus API.
Intermediate states are states that the blob can be in while being processed, and it can be updated to a different state:
- PROCESSING
- DISPERSING
- CONFIRMED
Terminal states are states that will not be updated to a different state:
- FAILED
- FINALIZED
- INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES

| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| UNKNOWN | 0 |  |
| PROCESSING | 1 | PROCESSING means that the blob is currently being processed by the disperser |
| CONFIRMED | 2 | CONFIRMED means that the blob has been dispersed to DA Nodes and the dispersed batch containing the blob has been confirmed onchain |
| FAILED | 3 | FAILED means that the blob has failed permanently (for reasons other than insufficient signatures, which is a separate state). This status is somewhat of a catch-all category, containing (but not necessarily exclusively as errors can be added in the future): - blob has expired - internal logic error while requesting encoding - blob retry has exceeded its limit while waiting for blob finalization after confirmation. Most likely triggered by a chain reorg: see https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/master/disperser/batcher/finalizer.go#L179-L189. |
| FINALIZED | 4 | FINALIZED means that the block containing the blob&#39;s confirmation transaction has been finalized on Ethereum |
| INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES | 5 | INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES means that the confirmation threshold for the blob was not met for at least one quorum. |
| DISPERSING | 6 | The DISPERSING state is comprised of two separate phases: - Dispersing to DA nodes and collecting signature - Submitting the transaction on chain and waiting for tx receipt |

### Disperser
Disperser defines the public APIs for dispersing blobs.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| DisperseBlob | [DisperseBlobRequest](#disperser-DisperseBlobRequest) | [DisperseBlobReply](#disperser-DisperseBlobReply) | DisperseBlob accepts a single blob to be dispersed. This executes the dispersal async, i.e. it returns once the request is accepted. The client should use GetBlobStatus() API to poll the processing status of the blob.

If DisperseBlob returns the following error codes: INVALID_ARGUMENT (400): request is invalid for a reason specified in the error msg. RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (429): request is rate limited for the quorum specified in the error msg. user should retry after the specified duration. INTERNAL (500): serious error, user should NOT retry. |
| DisperseBlobAuthenticated | [AuthenticatedRequest](#disperser-AuthenticatedRequest) stream | [AuthenticatedReply](#disperser-AuthenticatedReply) stream | DisperseBlobAuthenticated is similar to DisperseBlob, except that it requires the client to authenticate itself via the AuthenticationData message. The protocol is as follows: 1. The client sends a DisperseBlobAuthenticated request with the DisperseBlobRequest message 2. The Disperser sends back a BlobAuthHeader message containing information for the client to verify and sign. 3. The client verifies the BlobAuthHeader and sends back the signed BlobAuthHeader in an 	 AuthenticationData message. 4. The Disperser verifies the signature and returns a DisperseBlobReply message. |
| GetBlobStatus | [BlobStatusRequest](#disperser-BlobStatusRequest) | [BlobStatusReply](#disperser-BlobStatusReply) | This API is meant to be polled for the blob status. |
| RetrieveBlob | [RetrieveBlobRequest](#disperser-RetrieveBlobRequest) | [RetrieveBlobReply](#disperser-RetrieveBlobReply) | This retrieves the requested blob from the Disperser&#39;s backend. This is a more efficient way to retrieve blobs than directly retrieving from the DA Nodes (see detail about this approach in api/proto/retriever/retriever.proto). The blob should have been initially dispersed via this Disperser service for this API to work. |

When blob is in GATHERING_SIGNATURES status, the attestation object in signed_batch contains attestation information at the point in time. As it gathers more signatures, attestation object will be updated according to the latest attestation status. The client can use this intermediate attestation to verify a blob if it has gathered enough signatures. Otherwise, it should should poll the GetBlobStatus API until the desired level of attestation has been gathered or status is COMPLETE. When blob is in COMPLETE status, the attestation object in signed_batch contains the final attestation information. If the final attestation does not meet the client&#39;s requirement, the client should try a new dispersal. |

### DisperseBlobReply
A reply to a DisperseBlob request.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| result | [BlobStatus](#disperser-v2-BlobStatus) |  | The status of the blob associated with the blob key. |
| blob_key | [bytes](#bytes) |  | The unique 32 byte identifier for the blob.

The blob_key is the keccak hash of the rlp serialization of the BlobHeader, as computed here: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/0f14d1c90b86d29c30ff7e92cbadf2762c47f402/core/v2/serialization.go#L30 The blob_key must thus be unique for every request, even if the same blob is being dispersed. Meaning the blob_header must be different for each request.

Note that attempting to disperse a blob with the same blob key as a previously dispersed blob may cause the disperser to reject the blob (DisperseBlob() RPC will return an error). |






<a name="disperser-v2-DisperseBlobRequest"></a>

### DisperseBlobRequest
A request to disperse a blob.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| blob | [bytes](#bytes) |  | The blob to be dispersed.

The size of this byte array may be any size as long as it does not exceed the maximum length of 16MiB. While the data being dispersed is only required to be greater than 0 bytes, the blob size charged against the payment method will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of `minNumSymbols` defined by the payment vault contract (https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/1430d56258b4e814b388e497320fd76354bfb478/contracts/src/payments/PaymentVaultStorage.sol#L9).

Every 32 bytes of data is interpreted as an integer in big endian format where the lower address has more significant bits. The integer must stay in the valid range to be interpreted as a field element on the bn254 curve. The valid range is 0 &lt;= x &lt; 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617. If any one of the 32 bytes elements is outside the range, the whole request is deemed as invalid, and rejected. |
| blob_header | [common.v2.BlobHeader](#common-v2-BlobHeader) |  | The header contains metadata about the blob.

This header can be thought of as an &#34;eigenDA tx&#34;, in that it plays a purpose similar to an eth_tx to disperse a 4844 blob. Note that a call to DisperseBlob requires the blob and the blobHeader, which is similar to how dispersing a blob to ethereum requires sending a tx whose data contains the hash of the kzg commit of the blob, which is dispersed separately. |

<a name="disperser-v2-BlobStatus"></a>

### BlobStatus
BlobStatus represents the status of a blob.
The status of a blob is updated as the blob is processed by the disperser.
The status of a blob can be queried by the client using the GetBlobStatus API.
Intermediate states are states that the blob can be in while being processed, and it can be updated to a different state:
- QUEUED
- ENCODED
- GATHERING_SIGNATURES
Terminal states are states that will not be updated to a different state:
- UNKNOWN
- COMPLETE
- FAILED

| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| UNKNOWN | 0 | UNKNOWN means that the status of the blob is unknown. This is a catch all and should not be encountered absent a bug.

This status is functionally equivalent to FAILED, but is used to indicate that the failure is due to an unanticipated bug. |
| QUEUED | 1 | QUEUED means that the blob has been queued by the disperser for processing. The DisperseBlob API is asynchronous, meaning that after request validation, but before any processing, the blob is stored in a queue of some sort, and a response immediately returned to the client. |
| ENCODED | 2 | ENCODED means that the blob has been Reed-Solomon encoded into chunks and is ready to be dispersed to DA Nodes. |
| GATHERING_SIGNATURES | 3 | GATHERING_SIGNATURES means that the blob chunks are currently actively being transmitted to validators, and in doing so requesting that the validators sign to acknowledge receipt of the blob. Requests that timeout or receive errors are resubmitted to DA nodes for some period of time set by the disperser, after which the BlobStatus becomes COMPLETE. |
| COMPLETE | 4 | COMPLETE means the blob has been dispersed to DA nodes, and the GATHERING_SIGNATURES period of time has completed. This status does not guarantee any signer percentage, so a client should check that the signature has met its required threshold, and resubmit a new blob dispersal request if not. |
| FAILED | 5 | FAILED means that the blob has failed permanently. Note that this is a terminal state, and in order to retry the blob, the client must submit the blob again (blob key is required to be unique). |

### Disperser
Disperser defines the public APIs for dispersing blobs.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| DisperseBlob | [DisperseBlobRequest](#disperser-v2-DisperseBlobRequest) | [DisperseBlobReply](#disperser-v2-DisperseBlobReply) | DisperseBlob accepts blob to disperse from clients. This executes the dispersal asynchronously, i.e. it returns once the request is accepted. The client could use GetBlobStatus() API to poll the the processing status of the blob. |
| GetBlobStatus | [BlobStatusRequest](#disperser-v2-BlobStatusRequest) | [BlobStatusReply](#disperser-v2-BlobStatusReply) | GetBlobStatus is meant to be polled for the blob status. |
| GetBlobCommitment | [BlobCommitmentRequest](#disperser-v2-BlobCommitmentRequest) | [BlobCommitmentReply](#disperser-v2-BlobCommitmentReply) | GetBlobCommitment is a utility method that calculates commitment for a blob payload. It is provided to help clients who are trying to construct a DisperseBlobRequest.blob_header and don&#39;t have the ability to calculate the commitment themselves (expensive operation which requires SRS points).

For an example usage, see how our disperser_client makes a call to this endpoint when it doesn&#39;t have a local prover: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/6059c6a068298d11c41e50f5bcd208d0da44906a/api/clients/v2/disperser_client.go#L166 |
| GetPaymentState | [GetPaymentStateRequest](#disperser-v2-GetPaymentStateRequest) | [GetPaymentStateReply](#disperser-v2-GetPaymentStateReply) | GetPaymentState is a utility method to get the payment state of a given account, at a given disperser. EigenDA&#39;s payment system for v2 is currently centralized, meaning that each disperser does its own accounting. A client wanting to disperse a blob would thus need to synchronize its local accounting state with that of the disperser. That typically only needs to be done once, and the state can be updated locally as the client disperses blobs. The accounting rules are simple and can be updated locally, but periodic checks with the disperser can&#39;t hurt.

For an example usage, see how our disperser_client makes a call to this endpoint to populate its local accountant struct: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/6059c6a068298d11c41e50f5bcd208d0da44906a/api/clients/v2/disperser_client.go#L298 |

<a name="retriever-Retriever"></a>

### Retriever
The Retriever is a service for retrieving chunks corresponding to a blob from
the EigenDA operator nodes and reconstructing the original blob from the chunks.
This is a client-side library that the users are supposed to operationalize.

Note: Users generally have two ways to retrieve a blob from EigenDA:
  1) Retrieve from the Disperser that the user initially used for dispersal: the API
     is Disperser.RetrieveBlob() as defined in api/proto/disperser/disperser.proto
  2) Retrieve directly from the EigenDA Nodes, which is supported by this Retriever.

The Disperser.RetrieveBlob() (the 1st approach) is generally faster and cheaper as the
Disperser manages the blobs that it has processed, whereas the Retriever.RetrieveBlob()
(the 2nd approach here) removes the need to trust the Disperser, with the downside of
worse cost and performance.

| UNKNOWN | 0 | A valid response should never use this value. If encountered, the client should treat it as an error. |
| GNARK | 1 | A chunk encoded in GNARK has the following format:

[KZG proof: 32 bytes] [Coeff 1: 32 bytes] [Coeff 2: 32 bytes] ... [Coeff n: 32 bytes]

The KZG proof is a point on G1 and is serialized with bn254.G1Affine.Bytes(). The coefficients are field elements in bn254 and serialized with fr.Element.Marshal().

### Dispersal
Dispersal is utilized to disperse chunk data.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| StoreChunks | [StoreChunksRequest](#validator-StoreChunksRequest) | [StoreChunksReply](#validator-StoreChunksReply) | StoreChunks instructs the validator to store a batch of chunks. This call blocks until the validator either acquires the chunks or the validator determines that it is unable to acquire the chunks. If the validator is able to acquire and validate the chunks, it returns a signature over the batch header. This RPC describes which chunks the validator should store but does not contain that chunk data. The validator is expected to fetch the chunk data from one of the relays that is in possession of the chunk. |
| GetNodeInfo | [GetNodeInfoRequest](#validator-GetNodeInfoRequest) | [GetNodeInfoReply](#validator-GetNodeInfoReply) | GetNodeInfo fetches metadata about the node. |


<a name="validator-Retrieval"></a>

### Retrieval
Retrieval is utilized to retrieve chunk data.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| GetChunks | [GetChunksRequest](#validator-GetChunksRequest) | [GetChunksReply](#validator-GetChunksReply) | GetChunks retrieves the chunks for a blob custodied at the Node. Note that where possible, it is generally faster to retrieve chunks from the relay service if that service is available. |
| GetNodeInfo | [GetNodeInfoRequest](#validator-GetNodeInfoRequest) | [GetNodeInfoReply](#validator-GetNodeInfoReply) | Retrieve node info metadata |
