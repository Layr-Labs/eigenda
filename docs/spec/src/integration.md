# EigenDA Integrations

This book is meant to be read by eigenda and rollup developers who are writing or extending an integration with EigenDA. 
Users and developers who just want to understand how an integration works at a high level, and need to learn
how to configure their own integration, should instead visit our [Integrations Guides](https://docs.eigenda.xyz/integrations-guides/overview).
