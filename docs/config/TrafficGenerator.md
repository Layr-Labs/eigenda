| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.FrequencyAcceleration}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_FREQUENCYACCELERATION` | `float64`<br>`0.0025` | FrequencyAcceleration determines the speed at which the frequency of blob submissions accelerates at startup time, in HZ/s.

The number of reads per relay is multiplied by this factor. For example, If this is set to 3, then each blob is read back from each relay 3 times. If less than 1, then this value is treated as a probability. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then each blob is read back from each relay with a 50% chance. If running with the proxy, this value is used to determine how many times to read each blob back from the proxy (since in the normal case, proxy reads translate to relay reads). |

| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.SubmissionParallelism}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_SUBMISSIONPARALLELISM` | `uint64`<br>`300` | The maximum number of parallel blobs submissions in flight. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.UseProxy}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_USEPROXY` | `bool`<br>`false` | If true, then route traffic through the proxy instead of directly using the GRPC clients. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.ValidatorReadAmplification}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORREADAMPLIFICATION` | `float64`<br>`1` | By default, this utility reads chunks once. The number of chunk reads is multiplied by this factor. If this is set to 3, then chunks are read back 3 times. If less than 1, then this value is treated as a probability. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then each chunk is read back from validators with a 50% chance. Ignored if the load generator is configured to use the proxy. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.ValidatorReadParallelism}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORREADPARALLELISM` | `uint64`<br>`300` | The maximum number of parallel blob validator read operations in flight. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.ValidatorReadTimeout}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORREADTIMEOUT` | `uint32`<br>`600` | The timeout for reading a blob from the validators, in seconds. This is the timeout per individual read. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{Load.ValidatorVerificationFraction}}$$<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORVERIFICATIONFRACTION` | `float64`<br>`0.01` | A number between 0 and 1.0 that specifies the fraction of blobs that are verified by the validator. If 1.0, all blobs are verified. If 0.0, no blobs are verified. If 0.5, half of the blobs are verified. |
