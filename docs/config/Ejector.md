# Ejector Configuration

## Required Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| $${\color{red}\texttt{ContractDirectoryAddress}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_CONTRACTDIRECTORYADDRESS` | `string` | The address of the contract directory contract. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{DataApiUrl}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_DATAAPIURL` | `string` | The URL of the Eigenda Data API to use for looking up signing rates. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EthRpcUrls}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_ETHRPCURLS` | `[]string` | The Ethereum RPC URL(s) to use for connecting to the blockchain. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{PrivateKey}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_PRIVATEKEY` | `string` | The private key to use for signing ejection transactions. |

## Optional Fields

| Name | Type<br>Default | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| $${\color{red}\texttt{DataApiTimeout}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_DATAAPITIMEOUT` | `time.Duration`<br>`1m0s` | The timeout to use when making requests to the Data API. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{DoNotEjectTheseValidators}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_DONOTEJECTTHESEVALIDATORS` | `[]string`<br>`[]` | A list of validator addresses that we should never attempt to eject, even if they otherwise meet the ejection criteria. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionCriteriaTimeWindow}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONCRITERIATIMEWINDOW` | `time.Duration`<br>`10m0s` | The time window over which to evaluate signing metrics when deciding whether to eject a validator. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionFinalizationDelay}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONFINALIZATIONDELAY` | `time.Duration`<br>`1h0m0s` | The time between starting an ejection and when the ejection can be finalized. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionFinalizationPeriod}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONFINALIZATIONPERIOD` | `time.Duration`<br>`1m0s` | The period at which to periodically attempt to finalize ejections that have been started. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionPeriod}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONPERIOD` | `time.Duration`<br>`1m0s` | The period with which to evaluate validators for ejection. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionRetryDelay}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONRETRYDELAY` | `time.Duration`<br>`24h0m0s` | The minimum time to wait before retrying a failed ejection. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionThrottle}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONTHROTTLE` | `float64`<br>`0.05` | The maximum fraction of stake (out of 1.0) that can be ejected during an ejection time period. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EjectionThrottleTimePeriod}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_EJECTIONTHROTTLETIMEPERIOD` | `time.Duration`<br>`24h0m0s` | The time period over which the ejection rate limit is calculated. The ejection manager will be allowed to eject ejectionRateLimit fraction of stake every EjectionThrottleTimePeriod. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EthBlockConfirmations}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_ETHBLOCKCONFIRMATIONS` | `int`<br>`0` | The number of block confirmations to wait for before considering an ejection transaction to be confirmed. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{EthRpcRetryCount}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_ETHRPCRETRYCOUNT` | `int`<br>`3` | The number of times to retry a failed Ethereum RPC call. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{MaxConsecutiveFailedEjectionAttempts}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_MAXCONSECUTIVEFAILEDEJECTIONATTEMPTS` | `uint32`<br>`5` | The maximum number of consecutive failed ejection attempts before giving up on ejecting a validator. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{StartEjectionThrottleFull}}$$<br>`EJECTOR_STARTEJECTIONTHROTTLEFULL` | `bool`<br>`false` | If true, then the ejection manager will immediately be able to eject ejectionRateLimit fraction of stake when it starts up. If false, then the ejection manager will need to wait before it has this capacity. |
