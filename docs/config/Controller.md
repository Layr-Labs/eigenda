# Controller Configuration

## Optional Fields

| Name | Type<br>Default | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| $${\color{red}\texttt{AttestationTimeout}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT` | `time.Duration`<br>`45s` | AttestationTimeout is the maximum time to wait for a single node to provide a signature. Must be positive. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{BatchAttestationTimeout}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_BATCH_ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT` | `time.Duration`<br>`55s` | BatchAttestationTimeout is the maximum time to wait for all nodes to provide signatures for a batch. Must be positive and must be longer or equal to the AttestationTimeout. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{BatchMetadataUpdatePeriod}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_BATCH_METADATA_UPDATE_PERIOD` | `time.Duration`<br>`1m0s` | BatchMetadataUpdatePeriod is the interval between attempts to refresh batch metadata (reference block number and operator state). Since this changes at most once per eth block, values shorter than 10 seconds are not useful. In practice, checking every several minutes is sufficient. Must be positive. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{FinalizationBlockDelay}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_FINALIZATION_BLOCK_DELAY` | `uint64`<br>`75` | FinalizationBlockDelay is the number of blocks to wait before using operator state. This provides a hedge against chain reorganizations. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{MaxBatchSize}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` | `int32`<br>`32` | MaxBatchSize is the maximum number of blobs to include in a single batch for dispersal. Must be at least 1. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{NodeClientCacheSize}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_NODE_CLIENT_CACHE_SIZE` | `int`<br>`400` | NodeClientCacheSize is the maximum number of node clients to cache for reuse. Must be at least 1. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{NumConcurrentRequests}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_NUM_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | `int`<br>`600` | NumConcurrentRequests is the size of the worker pool for processing dispersal requests concurrently. Must be at least 1. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{NumRequestRetries}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_NUM_REQUEST_RETRIES` | `int`<br>`0` | NumRequestRetries is the number of times to retry dispersing to a node after the initial attempt fails. The current implementation has performance issues, so this should typically be 0 (no retries). Must be non-negative. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{PullInterval}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_PULL_INTERVAL` | `time.Duration`<br>`1s` | PullInterval is how frequently the controller polls for new encoded blobs to batch and dispatch. Must be positive. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{SignatureTickInterval}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_SIGNATURE_TICK_INTERVAL` | `time.Duration`<br>`50ms` | SignatureTickInterval is how frequently attestations are updated in the blob metadata store as signature gathering progresses. Must be positive. |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{SignificantSigningMetricsThresholds}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_SIGNIFICANT_SIGNING_METRICS_THRESHOLDS` | `[]string`<br>`[0.55 0.67]` | SignificantSigningMetricsThresholds are signing thresholds for metrics reporting. Values should be decimal strings between "0.0" (0% signed) and "1.0" (100% signed). Example: []string{"0.55", "0.67"} |
| $${\color{red}\texttt{SignificantSigningThresholdPercentage}}$$<br>`CONTROLLER_SIGNIFICANT_SIGNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE` | `uint8`<br>`55` | SignificantSigningThresholdPercentage is a configurable "important" signing threshold percentage. Used to track signing metrics and understand system performance. If the value is 0, special handling for this threshold is disabled. Must be between 0 and 100. |
