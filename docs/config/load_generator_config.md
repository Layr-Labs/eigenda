| `Environment.SRSNumberToLoad`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_ENVIRONMENT_SRSNUMBERTOLOAD` | `uint64` | `0` | The SRS number to load, increasing this beyond necessary can cause the client to take a long time to start |
| `Environment.SRSOrder`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_ENVIRONMENT_SRSORDER` | `uint64` | `268435456` | The SRS order to use for the test |
| `Environment.ValidatorReadComputePoolSize`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_ENVIRONMENT_VALIDATORREADCOMPUTEPOOLSIZE` | `int` | `20` | The size of the thread pool for CPU heavy operations. |
| `Environment.ValidatorReadConnectionPoolSize`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_ENVIRONMENT_VALIDATORREADCONNECTIONPOOLSIZE` | `int` | `100` | The size of the thread pool for read operations. |
| `Load.BlobSizeMB`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_BLOBSIZEMB` | `float64` | `2` | The size of the blobs to write, in megabytes. |
| `Load.DispersalTimeout`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_DISPERSALTIMEOUT` | `uint32` | `600` | The timeout for each blob dispersal, in seconds. |
| `Load.EnablePprof`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_ENABLEPPROF` | `bool` | `false` | EnablePprof enables the pprof HTTP server for profiling |
| `Load.FrequencyAcceleration`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_FREQUENCYACCELERATION` | `float64` | `0.0025` | FrequencyAcceleration determines the speed at which the frequency of blob submissions accelerates at startup<br>time, in HZ/s. Frequency will start at 0 and accelerate to the target frequency at this rate. If 0, then<br>the frequency will immediately be set to the target frequency. |
| `Load.GasEstimationParallelism`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_GASESTIMATIONPARALLELISM` | `uint64` | `300` | The maximum number of parallel gas estimation operations in flight. |
| `Load.GasEstimationTimeout`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_GASESTIMATIONTIMEOUT` | `uint32` | `15` | The timeout for gas estimation operations, in seconds. |

| `Load.PprofHttpPort`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_PPROFHTTPPORT` | `int` | `6060` | PprofHttpPort is the port that the pprof HTTP server listens on |
| `Load.RelayReadAmplification`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_RELAYREADAMPLIFICATION` | `float64` | `1` | By default, this utility reads each blob back from each relay once. The number of<br>reads per relay is multiplied by this factor. For example, If this is set to 3,<br>then each blob is read back from each relay 3 times. If less than 1, then this value<br>is treated as a probability. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then each blob is read back<br>from each relay with a 50% chance. If running with the proxy, this value is used to determine<br>how many times to read each blob back from the proxy (since in the normal case, proxy reads translate<br>to relay reads). |
| `Load.RelayReadParallelism`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_RELAYREADPARALLELISM` | `uint64` | `300` | The maximum number of parallel blob relay read operations in flight. |
| `Load.RelayReadTimeout`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_RELAYREADTIMEOUT` | `uint32` | `600` | The timeout for reading a blob from a relay, in seconds. This is the timeout per individual read. |
| `Load.SubmissionParallelism`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_SUBMISSIONPARALLELISM` | `uint64` | `300` | The maximum number of parallel blobs submissions in flight. |
| `Load.UseProxy`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_USEPROXY` | `bool` | `false` | If true, then route traffic through the proxy instead of directly using the GRPC clients. |
| `Load.ValidatorReadAmplification`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORREADAMPLIFICATION` | `float64` | `1` | By default, this utility reads chunks once. The number of chunk reads is multiplied<br>by this factor. If this is set to 3, then chunks are read back 3 times. If less than 1,<br>then this value is treated as a probability. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then<br>each chunk is read back from validators with a 50% chance. Ignored if the load generator is configured<br>to use the proxy. |
| `Load.ValidatorReadParallelism`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORREADPARALLELISM` | `uint64` | `300` | The maximum number of parallel blob validator read operations in flight. |
| `Load.ValidatorReadTimeout`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORREADTIMEOUT` | `uint32` | `600` | The timeout for reading a blob from the validators, in seconds. This is the timeout per individual read. |
| `Load.ValidatorVerificationFraction`<br>`TRAFFIC_GENERATOR_LOAD_VALIDATORVERIFICATIONFRACTION` | `float64` | `0.01` | A number between 0 and 1.0 that specifies the fraction of blobs that are verified by the validator.<br>If 1.0, all blobs are verified. If 0.0, no blobs are verified. If 0.5, half of the blobs are verified. |
