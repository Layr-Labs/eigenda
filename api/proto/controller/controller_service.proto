  // to gain access to it.
  // - In the event that an unauthorized party were to gain access to this endpoint, the attack surface area is still
  // minimal: client signatures are being checked, and we protect against replay. Therefore, the attacker wouldn't be
  // able to waste user funds. They would only be able to attack the liveness of the Controller through high submission
  // volume, which would be a vulnerability regardless of whether we had auth between the API server and the Controller.
