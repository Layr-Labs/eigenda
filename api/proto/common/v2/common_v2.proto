  // If the timestamp is not set or is not part of the previous or current reservation period, the request will be rejected.
  // The reservation period of the dispersal request is used for rate-limiting the user's account against their dedicated 
  // bandwidth. This method requires users to set up reservation accounts with EigenDA team, and the team will set up an 
  // on-chain record of reserved bandwidth for the user for some period of time. The dispersal client's accountant will set 
  // this value to the current timestamp in nanoseconds. The disperser server will find the corresponding reservation period by 
  // taking the nearest lower multiple of the on-chain configured reservation period interval, mapping each request 
  // to a time-based window and is serialized and parsed as a uint32. The disperser server then validates that it matches 
  // either the current or the previous period, and check against the user's reserved bandwidth.
  //
  // Example Usage Flow:
  //   1. The user sets up a reservation with the EigenDA team, including throughput (symbolsPerSecond), startTimestamp,
  //      endTimestamp, and reservationPeriodInterval.
  //   2. When sending a dispersal request at time t, the client fill in the timestamp field with t.
  //   3. The disperser take timestamp t and checks the reservation period and the user's bandwidth capacity:
  //       - If the reservation is active (t >= startTimestamp and t < endTimestamp).
  //       - After rounding up to the nearest multiple of `minNumSymbols` defined by the payment vault contract, the user still has enough bandwidth capacity
  //         (hasn’t exceeded symbolsPerSecond * reservationPeriodInterval).
  //       - The request is ratelimited against the current reservation period, and calculated as reservation_period = floor(t / reservationPeriodInterval) * reservationPeriodInterval.
  //         the request's reservation period must either be the disperser server's current reservation period or the previous reservation period. 
  //   4. Server always go ahead with recording the received request in the current reservation period, and then categorize the scenarios 
  //       - If the remaining bandwidth is sufficient for the request, the dispersal request proceeds.
  //       - If the remaining bandwidth is not enough for the request, server fills up the current bin and overflowing the extra to a future bin.
  //       - If the bandwidth has already been exhausted, the request is rejected. 
  //   5. Once the dispersal request signature has been verified, the server will not roll back the payment or the usage records.
  //      Users should be aware of this when planning their usage. The dispersal client written by EigenDA team takes account of this. 
  //   6. When the reservation ends or usage is exhausted, the client must wait for the next reservation period or switch to on-demand.

  // Cumulative payment is the total amount of tokens paid by the requesting account, including the current request.
  // This value is serialized as an uint256 and parsed as a big integer, and must match the user’s on-chain deposit limits
  // as well as the recorded payments for all previous requests. 
  //
  // Example Decision Flow:
  //   1. In the set up phase, the user must deposit tokens into the EigenDA PaymentVault contract. The payment vault contract
  //    specifies the minimum number of symbols charged per dispersal, the pricing per symbol, and the maximum global rate for 
  //    on-demand dispersals. The user should calculate the amount of tokens they would like to deposit based on their usage. 
  //   2. The first time a user makes a request, server will immediate read the contract for the on-chain balance. When user runs 
  //    out of on-chain balance, the server will reject the dispersal request. When a user tops up on-chain, 
  //    the server will refresh every few minutes for the user top-up to take effect.
  //   3. The disperser client accounts how many tokens they’ve already paid (previousCumPmt).
  //   4. Disperser client calculates the price of a request by rounding up blob size to the nearest multiple of `minNumSymbols` 
  //    and then multiply by `pricePerSymbol` as defined by the payment vault contract. Client considers it as the required charge 
  //    of the blob dispersal request. 
  //   4. Dispersal client takes the sum of previousCumPmt + charge and place it in the “cumulative_payment” field as part of the request header.
  //   5. The disperser checks this new cumulative total against on-chain deposits and the largest seen payment from the same client.
  //   6. If the “cumulative_payment” field is not valid, the request is rejected.
  //   7. If the “cumulative_payment” field is valid, the disperser will check the request usage against the current global ratelimiting period's
  //    on-demand usage. If the new global on-demand usage doesn't exceed the maximum, then dispersal request should proceed. If the disperser 
  //    the new usage does exceed the maximum, then dispersal request is rejected with payments not charged against the client.
