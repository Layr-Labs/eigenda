# v1 and v2 APIs

With the [EigenDA v2 release](https://docs.eigencloud.xyz/products/eigenda/releases/blazar), a number 
of APIs have been updated for the v2 release, and new APIs added. Use the v2 APIs. 

The v1 APIs will be deprecated at a future date. A long deprecation period will occur and be actively communicated.

For an overview of the APIs, refer to the [EigenDA documentation](https://docs.eigencloud.xyz/products/eigenda/core-concepts/overview). For low level details, refer to the `.proto` files 
in this directory.
