# Should I use the v2 API?

No. The v2 API is currently under active development, and is not yet deployed to any environment.

# Is the v2 API stable?

No, although it is becoming more stable as the v2 design matures.

# What is "v2"?

The EigenDA v2 Architecture is a fundamental redesign of the protocol. The v2 Architecture improves robustness,
efficiency, and paves the way for upcoming features such as permissionless disperser instances
and data availability sampling.

We intend on publishing a more detailed roadmap and design overview in the near future, stay tuned!
