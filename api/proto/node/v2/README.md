The EigenDA v2 Architecture is a fundamental redesign of the disperser, and by extension systems that interact
with the disperser. The v2 Architecture is an important stepping stone towards reducing centralization and for
enabling data availability sampling. We intend on publishing a more detailed roadmap and design overview in the near
future, stay tuned!
