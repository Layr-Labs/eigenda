# We currently only push the eigenda proto files to the buf registry
# in order for it to generate rust prost/tonic bindings for us.
# We also get nice documentation and versioning: see https://buf.build/layrlabs/eigenda.

# For details on buf.yaml configuration, visit https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v2/buf-yaml
version: v2
modules:
  - path: proto
    name: buf.build/layrlabs/eigenda
# This linter was added after the proto files were already used in production.
# We added a bunch of ignore lint comments inside the protobuf files themselves,
# instead of turning off rules entirely here.
# This way any new protobuf messages or services will follow the
# protobuf conventions: https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/style/
