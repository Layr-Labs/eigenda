	// Since blobs sent to the disperser must be in coefficient form, the initial form of the encoded payload dictates
	// what data processing must be performed during blob construction.
	//
	// The chosen form also dictates how the KZG commitment made to the blob can be used. If the encoded payload starts
	// in PolynomialFormEval (meaning the data WILL be IFFTed before computing the commitment) then it will be possible
	// to open points on the KZG commitment to prove that the field elements correspond to the commitment. If the
	// encoded payload starts in PolynomialFormCoeff (meaning the data will NOT be IFFTed before computing the
	// commitment) then it will not be possible to create a commitment opening: the blob will need to be supplied in its
	// entirety to perform a verification that any part of the data matches the KZG commitment.
