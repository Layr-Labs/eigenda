<a name="disperser-BlobAuthHeader"></a>

### BlobAuthHeader
BlobAuthHeader contains information about the blob for the client to verify and sign.
- Once payments are enabled, the BlobAuthHeader will contain the KZG commitment to the blob, which the client
will verify and sign. Having the client verify the KZG commitment instead of calculating it avoids
the need for the client to have the KZG structured reference string (SRS), which can be large.
The signed KZG commitment prevents the disperser from sending a different blob to the DA Nodes
than the one the client sent.
- In the meantime, the BlobAuthHeader contains a simple challenge parameter is used to prevent
replay attacks in the event that a signature is leaked.

Two different DisperseBlobRequests (determined by the hash of the DisperseBlobRequest) will have different IDs, and the same DisperseBlobRequest sent repeatedly at different times will also have different IDs. The client should use this ID to query the processing status of the request (via the GetBlobStatus API). |

The valid range is 0 &lt;= x &lt; 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617 containing slightly less than 254 bits and more than 253 bits.

<a name="disperser-BlobStatus"></a>

### BlobStatus
BlobStatus represents the status of a blob.
The status of a blob is updated as the blob is processed by the disperser.
The status of a blob can be queried by the client using the GetBlobStatus API.
Intermediate states are states that the blob can be in while being processed, and it can be updated to a differet state:
- PROCESSING
- DISPERSING
- CONFIRMED
Terminal states are states that will not be updated to a different state:
- FAILED
- FINALIZED
- INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES

| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| UNKNOWN | 0 |  |
| PROCESSING | 1 | PROCESSING means that the blob is currently being processed by the disperser |
| CONFIRMED | 2 | CONFIRMED means that the blob has been dispersed to DA Nodes and the dispersed batch containing the blob has been confirmed onchain |
| FAILED | 3 | FAILED means that the blob has failed permanently (for reasons other than insufficient signatures, which is a separate state) |
| FINALIZED | 4 | FINALIZED means that the block containing the blob&#39;s confirmation transaction has been finalized on Ethereum |
| INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES | 5 | INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES means that the confirmation threshold for the blob was not met for at least one quorum. |
| DISPERSING | 6 | DISPERSING means that the blob is currently being dispersed to DA Nodes and being confirmed onchain |

### Disperser
Disperser defines the public APIs for dispersing blobs.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| DisperseBlob | [DisperseBlobRequest](#disperser-DisperseBlobRequest) | [DisperseBlobReply](#disperser-DisperseBlobReply) | This API accepts blob to disperse from clients. This executes the dispersal async, i.e. it returns once the request is accepted. The client could use GetBlobStatus() API to poll the the processing status of the blob. |
| DisperseBlobAuthenticated | [AuthenticatedRequest](#disperser-AuthenticatedRequest) stream | [AuthenticatedReply](#disperser-AuthenticatedReply) stream | DisperseBlobAuthenticated is similar to DisperseBlob, except that it requires the client to authenticate itself via the AuthenticationData message. The protoco is as follows: 1. The client sends a DisperseBlobAuthenticated request with the DisperseBlobRequest message 2. The Disperser sends back a BlobAuthHeader message containing information for the client to verify and sign. 3. The client verifies the BlobAuthHeader and sends back the signed BlobAuthHeader in an 	 AuthenticationData message. 4. The Disperser verifies the signature and returns a DisperseBlobReply message. |
| GetBlobStatus | [BlobStatusRequest](#disperser-BlobStatusRequest) | [BlobStatusReply](#disperser-BlobStatusReply) | This API is meant to be polled for the blob status. |
| RetrieveBlob | [RetrieveBlobRequest](#disperser-RetrieveBlobRequest) | [RetrieveBlobReply](#disperser-RetrieveBlobReply) | This retrieves the requested blob from the Disperser&#39;s backend. This is a more efficient way to retrieve blobs than directly retrieving from the DA Nodes (see detail about this approach in api/proto/retriever/retriever.proto). The blob should have been initially dispersed via this Disperser service for this API to work. |
