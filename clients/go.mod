// We use a separate module for the client to allow dependencies to import it without importing all of proxy's main module's dependencies.
// This follows the recommendation in: https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#should-i-have-multiple-modules-in-a-single-repository
//
// Two example scenarios where it can make sense to have more than one go.mod in a repository:
// 1. [omitted]
// 2. if you have a repository with a complex set of dependencies, but you have a client API with a smaller set of dependencies.
//    In some cases, it might make sense to have an api or clientapi or similar directory with its own go.mod, or to separate out that clientapi into its own repository.
