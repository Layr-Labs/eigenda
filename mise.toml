# The exact version here doesn't matter because the `go` command is forward compatible,
# meaning that it will automatically download a golang version (as a module) to match the
# go and toolchain versions specified in the go.mod file.
# See https://go.dev/blog/toolchain for more details.
# We still want *some* go version here so that the `go` command is available though.
